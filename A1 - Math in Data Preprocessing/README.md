# A1: Math in Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves addressing a set of problems that arise in raw datasets. This process ensures the data is clean, consistent, and suitable for analysis or modeling. Key techniques include:

- **Data Normalization**: Scaling data to fall within a specific range or distribution, making it suitable for machine learning models.
- **Binning**: Grouping continuous data into discrete intervals to reduce noise or simplify the representation.
- **Linear Regression**: Utilizing a statistical method to model relationships between variables and to impute missing data or detect trends.
